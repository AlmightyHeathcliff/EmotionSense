## EmotionSense
Emotions are really an important part of our lives and have enough power to change it for better or bad.
so we made an android app which help us detect emotions either from written text or an image.

We build it using **Microsoft Cognitive services** and everything else is just an abstraction.

The Project is a tech hack developed for * __Hack 2.0__ *  by Team - **App Rangers**
